Personal Information

Greetings visitor! My name is Fjodor Zadonski and it's a great pleasure to welcome you to my website.
Currently I'm a 21-year-old undergraduate student at Melbourne's RMIT University studying a bachelor's degree in Business (Economics & Finance)
My home country is Estonia which I dearly love, however, my family's culture and background is mostly Russian with some traces to other eastern European countries.
All that led to me speaking both Russian and Estonian fluently and learning to enjoy hanging out with both cultures.
Aside from spending time with friends I enjoy playing sports such as basketball and football but I also am a big fan of online multiplayer games especially the likes of Dota 2 and CS:GO.
If you ever find yourself missing a fifth player just drop me an e-mail at s3572982@student.rmit.edu.au and we'll secure some wins together!
