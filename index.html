									<p>Greetings visitor! My name is Fjodor Zadonski and it's a great pleasure to welcome you to my website.
Currently I'm a 21-year-old undergraduate student at Melbourne's RMIT University studying a bachelor's degree in Business (Economics & Finance)
My home country is Estonia which I dearly love, however, my family's culture and background is mostly Russian with some traces to other eastern European countries.
All that led to me speaking both Russian and Estonian fluently and learning to enjoy hanging out with both cultures.
Aside from spending time with friends I enjoy playing sports such as basketball and football but I also am a big fan of online multiplayer games especially the likes of Dota 2 and CS:GO.
If you ever find yourself missing a fifth player just drop me an e-mail at s3572982@student.rmit.edu.au and we'll secure some wins together! </p>

									<h3>Interest In IT</h3>
									<p>Since getting my first computer at the age of 14 I have spent countless hours behind it either playing games, watching online videos/movies or just chatting to friends.
Throughout my studies at RMIT I have realised that in order to use my Business Degree to its full potential I would also have to understand bit of IT.
That is what led me to picking 2 IT electives in my last semester at RMIT so that I would have at least little experience or understanding in the field.

As mentioned above I am not new to RMIT but actually in my last semester. The initial reason for choosing this university was to get away from bad weather in Estonia and explore the world while studying.
Additionally, Melbourne had and has been winning "Most Liveable City" titles only giving me more reasons to choose RMIT for studies.

Most of my core subjects are now done and I would say I managed to take out all that interested me and is necessary.
However, I do still have some expectations for this last semester as I am mostly doing electives.
First of all, I would like to be able to design and create a fully functioning website for a company in tertiary sector like a hotel or clinic.
Second thing I wish to learn this semester is how to properly program. I am not expecting to learn to anything too difficult, maybe like a simple mobile app or chatterbot.</p>

									<h3>Ideal Job</h3>
									<p>IT Manager, https://www.seek.com.au/job/38683946?type=standout&searchrequesttoken=117fafce-b606-4745-8303-77733e101966
The job title itself does not need any further explanation and as a business student I see becoming a manager as reaching a good check-point in life because I like striving towards leadership.
The job in the advertisement would require me to secure smooth and efficient procedures across all environments of the company meaning my job would never get boring due to all the different people I will interact with.
Furthermore, becoming IT manager would mean I am very proficient with countless aspects and skills when it comes to using a PC which has been something I have wanted since starting my business degree.

Talking more about qualifications and skills required there is two major strands. I would have to be excellent at customer service interactions while also possess exemplary technical skills in IT infrastructures, application architectures and networking.
Moreover, firm understanding of how ITIL and AGILE frameworks work is a must and how to operate Windows and Linux servers, SAN storage, backup/restore infrastructure, VMware VCenter, Citrix, Exchange, routers, enterprise firewalls, Cisco switches and routers.
Last requirements and I would say the hardest for me to achieve is a need for at least 8 years of experience in expert technical support together with 5 plus years of leading an IT infrastructure team. Bachelor's degree in IT is a preferred addition.

As of right now I have barely any qualifications with the only one being my IB diploma and soon Bachelor of Business Degree and still I would not be even quarter of the way to securing that IT manager job.
Even with some IT related electives I need to attend several other more advanced IT courses to broaden my IT skills and understanding horizon.
Once all the studying and practicing is done the next step would be start obtaining all the work experience they are looking for which I hopefully would be able to work towards while I am still studying.</p>

									<h3>Personal Profile</h3>
									<p>Personality test 1 (Myers-Briggs Style) https://www.16personalities.com/free-personality-test
In Myers-Briggs test I was named LOGISTICIAN (ISTJ-T) which to me means I am a person who prefers to work alone with my own pace and tactics.
I personally doubt result of this test will influence my group work much because I am almost always quietly sitting and listening to other people's ideas while commenting my opinion every now and then.
The result tells me more that I excel in solo assignments or work and can tirelessly work until the job is done.</p>
									<p>Personality test 2 (Learning Style) http://www.educationplanner.org/students/self-assessments/learning-styles-quiz.shtml
Learning style test shows what methods I use to learn the information. The result were that I am Visual/Tactile learner with 40% each and remaining 20% fell into Auditory category.
The test tells me susceptible to learn through either visuals like reading or seeing pictures while second half of learning comes through more "hands-on" experience as I remember and understand things by means of physical interaction. 
These results suggest that I should be looking for a team members who also excel when learning through visuals or physical activities. However, doing that would not necessarily put the team in advantage because diversity mostly helps.</p>
									<p>Personality test 3 (Big Five Style) https://openpsychometrics.org/tests/IPIP-BFFM/
The Big Five test might have the most influential results when it comes to my behaviour in team. It appears that I am quite likely to agree with my groupmates while still be very careful and diligent with work we do.
For me personally the results are quite pleasing as it means I am quite emotionally stable and open to new experiences.</p>

								<h3>Project Idea</h3>
									<p>Almost every modern phone nowadays has an inbuilt NFC chip which in my opinion does not get enough use by your average phone user. 
The idea behind this project is to start using the mobile phones NFC capabilities to full extent while getting rid of some old-fashioned devices and accessories in order to make persons everyday life smoother and quicker.

Present-day access to facilities and houses is overcomplicated by the number of things you need to have on person to enter. To be more specific itâ€™s the key-card and key system that I see as a problem. 
There is 1,214,372 (2016*) separate apartments (including flats and units) in the whole Australia and vast majority of them use the key-card plus normal household key system.
In my opinion that is too many keys and key-cards to be carried around everyday which could be easily replaced by one thing that is almost always with you when you go somewhere: the mobile phone!

*Abs.gov.au. (2019). 2071.0 - Census of Population and Housing: Reflecting Australia - Stories from the Census, 2016.
[online] Available at: https://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/Lookup/by%20Subject/2071.0~2016~Main%20Features~Apartment%20Living~20 [Accessed 31 Mar. 2019]. 

The idea is fairly simple, you touch your phone against the key-card reader or intercom at the entrance and through NFC the household security system recognises your phone and gives you further access and then repeat once at the apartment door itself. Now this is not all as it leaves too many security and safety issues,
for example what if your phone gets stolen and that someone tries to access your apartment when youâ€™re out. In order to remove this problem a mobile phone APP needs to be developed which then would co-operate with the system and ask the person for a PIN-code or password making it harder for the criminal to get past the door. 
Even now it is still not secure enough for some peopleâ€™s tastes as the robber can find out the PIN. This is where the 2-step verification comes in to make sure clients belongings are safe. 
The second step would involve a use of biometric authentication such as face scan or fingerprint scan, both of which are more and more often implemented in smartphones coming to markets these days. Now that there is biometric security implemented no thief will be able to easily access the clients dwelling. 

The idea of this project does not only make everyday activity of entering ones home quicker and easier but at the same time also gets rid off over 2.5 million keys and key-cards that are needed to be carried around everyday replacement of which (in case of damage or loss) also costs ridiculous amounts of money to lessees and landlords. 
I wonâ€™t even be able to fully describe the environmental impact of printing all those plastic cards to replace the lost ones. 
The intercom systems would only require an update to assure the compatibility with the App making it ready to be used without any physical changes.

There are several initial drawbacks when it comes to this project and the major one being that not every phone has NFC built-in. However, that is not too big of a problem as in that case NFC stickers can be put on the back of the phone which wonâ€™t be too noticeable or thick and would weigh way less than the combination of a key and key-card. 
Secondly, a mobile App will need to be designed and developed to facilitate the PIN-code and biometric authentication security measures mentioned earlier. This is doable either through putting an order in with a third-party company that offers such services of creating Apps, which adds some guarantee of service, or by writing the software ourselves. 
The second method is likely to result in an App that has bugs and is not as polished as the end-user might prefer. Mostly because the team is going to be consisting of people still getting their bachelorâ€™s degrees who also have minimal experience in the field.
Hardest problem to solve would be the fact that even though biometric scanners are implemented in many phones there are still large numbers of ones without the scanners. The only solution as of now is to use the already existing intercom systems to capture the face and compare it with the picture on the server.

Overall project will have several outcomes affecting both peopleâ€™s everyday lives and environment. Entering the household would become hassle-free experience with only one piece of equipment required, which person carries in their pocket almost always anyways. 
The intercoms have already been discussed and nothing much will change when it comes to those. The reduced waste from lost keys or cards preserves the nature and reduces footprint we leave on our planet.
And of course, the most important part is where the person does not need to stress about forgetting their keys and getting locked out because one thing that almost no-one ever forgets is: their phone!</p>
